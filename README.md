Free Art Bots

ChatGPT: Are there free art bots similar to DALLE 2?

Yes, there are several free AI image generators that are similar to DALLE 2 in terms of their functionality and purpose. Here are a few examples:

Artbreeder - Artbreeder is a free online platform that uses AI to generate a wide variety of images, including portraits, landscapes, animals, and abstract designs. Users can combine and manipulate images to create their own unique designs.

GANBreeder - GANBreeder is another free AI image generator that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate unique and often surreal images. Users can adjust various parameters, such as the image size, number of iterations, and seed values to control the output.

This Person Does Not Exist - This Person Does Not Exist is a website that uses a machine learning model to generate realistic, but entirely fictional human faces. The model is trained on a large dataset of real faces, and generates new images that are often indistinguishable from actual photos.

Waifu Labs - Waifu Labs is a free AI image generator that specializes in creating anime-style characters. Users can customize various attributes of the characters, such as their hair, eyes, and clothing, to create their own unique designs.

BigGAN: This is an open-source machine learning model that was created by Google researchers. It can generate high-quality images across a range of categories, from animals and landscapes to architecture and art. You can use a pre-trained version of the model for free or train your own model with your own dataset.

StyleGAN: This is another open-source machine learning model that was created by NVIDIA researchers. It can generate high-quality images in a range of styles, from photorealistic to abstract. You can use a pre-trained version of the model for free or train your own model with your own dataset.

GPT-3: While GPT-3 is primarily known as a language model, it also has image generation capabilities. You can use it to generate images from text prompts, similar to DALLE 2. However, access to GPT-3 is currently limited and requires a paid subscription to OpenAI's API.
